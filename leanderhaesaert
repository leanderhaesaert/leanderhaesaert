### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Leander.

#### Let's get to know each other

I'm a former financial advisor, that is making a career change into front-end web development. The passion started with taking online courses and developing a website for our padel sports team. From that point, I know that I love coding and creating. I am more motivated than ever and very eager to learn to become an expert in this field. Besides that, I love design, have a strong interest in user experience and I am digital minded.

I am currently seeking for an opportunity as a front-end developer. In return you will receive a hard-working and enthusiastic colleague. So if you would like to work together, feel free to contact me â€“ always happy to have a chat with some good coffee!

**Skills:**

***Front-end:*** HTML5 / CSS3 / JS / jQuery / React

***UI/UX:*** ADOBE XD / PHOTOSHOP


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything about front-end development

âš¡ Fun fact: I love coffee & padel
